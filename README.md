#### What we are expecting from you is:

- Use styled components for styling
- Use enzyme and jest for testing
- Use React Router and React 16 (already included in the boilerplate code)
- Use Redux Saga for API requests

## Delivery before Sunday 11:59pm
Important. Constantly commit your code.

- Home View
  - It displays the trending GIFs using Giphy Trending API.
  - It has a search bar, which uses Giphy Search API.
  - Each GIF may be saved as favorite in the Redux state, and also can be removed from the same call to action.
  - Each GIF should display if it is already marked as favorite.

- Your Favorites GIFs View
  - It displays the GIFs that you previously selected, which comes from the Redux state.
